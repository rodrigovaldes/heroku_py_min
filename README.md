# Simple python job in Heroku

## Notes

1. It's recommended that you create a virtual environment before starting to set-up your app. **virtualenv vsp** (vsp is the name of the virtual environment, you may want to modify that)

2. To create the requirements.txt file, you can always use **pip freeze > requirements.txt**

3. You do not need a Procfile
